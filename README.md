# KingGame
I had to find a way to progress the game so after the character attacks the enemy, another character spawns. This is my first time using Unity and coding in C#. By default, I am using Virtual Studio. This is for the individual game in my Video Game Design class. 

# What I Learned 
- Using the on OnTriggerEnter2D() function to dettect the enemy tag
- Enable the character so that they appear on the screen. 
- Calling funtions in C#
- Attaching sprits to scripts
